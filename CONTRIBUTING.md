## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++17** compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- **CMake** 3.14 or higher
- **Git** for version control

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/VeloTask.git
   cd VeloTask
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/merlotqi/VeloTask.git
   ```

### Dependencies

TaskFlow uses the following dependencies:

- **[nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)**: For JSON data handling (automatically fetched via CMake if not found)
- **Threads**: System threading library

## 🛠 Development Environment

### Setting Up

1. Ensure you have CMake installed
2. Configure the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -S .. -B .
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

### IDE Setup

- **Visual Studio Code**: Use the provided `.vscode/` settings and extensions
- **CLion**: Automatically detects CMake configuration
- **VS Code with CMake Tools**: Recommended for best CMake integration

## 💅 Code Style

TaskFlow follows specific coding standards to maintain code quality and consistency.

### Formatting

- Use **clang-format** with the provided `.clang-format` configuration
- Based on Google style with 120 character line limit
- Run clang-format before committing:
  ```bash
  find . -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.hpp" | xargs clang-format -i
  ```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes/Structs**: PascalCase (e.g., `TaskManager`, `TaskCtx`)
- **Functions/Methods**: camelCase (e.g., `submit_task()`, `get_progress()`)
- **Variables**: snake_case (e.g., `task_id`, `progress_info`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_THREADS`)
- **Namespaces**: lowercase (e.g., `taskflow`)

### Code Guidelines

- **C++17 Features**: Use modern C++17 features where appropriate
- **Error Handling**: Use exceptions for exceptional cases, return values for expected errors
- **Documentation**: Document public APIs with clear comments
- **Thread Safety**: Ensure thread safety for shared resources
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications of changes

## 🏗 Building and Testing

Design documentation: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) and [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Build Process

```bash
# Configure
cmake -S . -B build

# Build
cmake --build build

# Build with specific configuration
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Build Options

- `TASKFLOW_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` (default): Build example programs
- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug|Release`: Build configuration

### Running Examples

After building, you can run individual examples:

```bash
# Run basic task submission example
./build/basic_task_submission

# Run multiple tasks example
./build/multiple_tasks

# Run task with progress example
./build/task_with_progress
```

### Testing

Examples are registered as CTest tests (`taskflow_example_*`). From the build directory:

```bash
ctest --output-on-failure
# or
cmake --build build --target taskflow_run_examples
```

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for the full executable list.

### Continuous integration

GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`):

- **ci.yaml** — Ubuntu, Clang, Debug, `clang-tidy` on `include/taskflow/`, build, CTest.
- **cmake-multi-platform.yaml** — Ubuntu (GCC and Clang) and macOS (Clang), Release, build, CTest; `clang-tidy` on Ubuntu Clang only.

Pull requests and pushes to `main` / `develop` run these workflows; you can also trigger them manually via **workflow_dispatch**.

## 📝 Submitting Changes

### Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable (e.g., "Fix #123: Handle edge case")
- Keep commits focused on single changes

### Example Commit Messages

```
Add support for custom progress types
Fix memory leak in task cancellation
Update documentation for persistent tasks
Refactor thread pool for better performance
```

### Branch Naming

- Use descriptive branch names
- Prefix with feature type: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`

```
feature/add-custom-result-types
bugfix/handle-cancellation-race-condition
docs/update-contribution-guide
refactor/simplify-task-traits
```

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`
2. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes with tests
